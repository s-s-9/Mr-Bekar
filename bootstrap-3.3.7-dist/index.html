					<h3 class = "text-info">What is this website?</h3>
					<p>Welcome. This is a website where Bekars can search, apply for and find jobs. With a profile here, 
					you will get to see job opening news of many reputed companies and can apply for an interview. 
					Here, you can enrich your profile with the skills you have and projects you made so that it attracts 
					companies that are hiring. Try to upgrade your skills, as job openings will only be visible to those who
					have the proper skills and know specific languages. Here, companies will post jobs, and eligible bekars
					can apply if they're interested. A company will analyze the profiles of the bekars that applied for a job 
					and offer them who seem fit for the job. A profile must include a resume, and projects must be uploaded 
					for each skill, else the companies won't know how awesome you are. And like that, your bekar days are gonna
					be over very soon. Best wishes.</p>

					<h3 class = "text-info">Get going right now</h3>
					<p>Start right now. Reach out. No company's gonna knock on doors searching for bekars to work for them. 
					You have to look for companies and start applying. First, develop a specific kind of skill set, so that 
					your preferences will be specific. Then, keep improving your skills by practicing and doing more and more 
					projects. You might not realize the importance of doing projects yet, but trust us, this is all companies 
					look for. Besides, solve problems, a lot of them. Every job interview has programming related questions, 
					so if you thought you can escape from programming, sorry, it just won't let you. Start by solving simple 
					problems in online judges or other websites, don't give up and you'll be pro in no time. Programming 
					is fun, and if you're afraid of it, you have no idea how awesome your life could have been.</p>

					<h3 class = "text-info">Don't get mad</h3>
					<p>We know it's frustrating being a Bekar. But this is just a temporary phase that you'll get over very soon. 
					In the mean time, prepare yourself for the bright future ahead by developing new skills and learning new 
					programming languages. Keep your hopes high. Whatever you learn will, at some point help you. Don't take 
					rejections personally, instead try to look at it from a sporting perspective. Job market is very competitive, 
					and you have to prove yourself worthy to get a place there. So instead of whining like a little bitch, get up, 
					learn and improve yourself!</p>
